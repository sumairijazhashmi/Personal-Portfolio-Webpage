# Personal Portfolio Webpage
I created a Personal Portfolio Webpage as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. This project is the last of five projects required to complete the certification. In this project, I had to build a website that was functionally similar to https://personal-portfolio.freecodecamp.rocks/.
